# Intro
VeinMiner is a plugin based on the Java Minecraft [VeinMiner](https://github.com/portablejim/VeinMiner) mod. Much of the code is also based on @2008Choco's [VeinMiner](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/veinminer.12038/) plugin for Bukkit and Fabric.

This is an updated version of the original VeinMiner plugin I created 3 years ago. We don't speak of that ugly garbage though.
